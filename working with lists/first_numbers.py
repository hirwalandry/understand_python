for value in range(1, 5):
 print(value)

#  In this example, range() prints only the numbers 1 through 4. This is another result of the off-by-one behavior youâ€™ll see often in programming languages. The range() function causes Python to start counting at the first value you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide. Because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end value, which would have been 5 in this case. To print the numbers from 1 to 5, you would use range(1, 6)

# Using range() to Make a List of Numbers
numbers = list(range(1, 6))
print(numbers)
