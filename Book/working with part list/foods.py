# Copying a List Often, you’ll want to start with an existing list and make an entirely new list based on the first one. Let’s explore how copying a list works and examine one situation in which copying a list is useful.To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]). This tells Python to make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, producing a copy of the entire list. For example, imagine we have a list of our favorite foods and want to make a separate list of foods that a friend likes. This friend likes everything in our list so far, so we can create their list by copying ours:

my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
friend_foods = my_foods[:]
my_foods.append('cannoli')
friend_foods.append('ice cream')
print("My favorite foods are:")
print(my_foods)
print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
print(friend_foods)
